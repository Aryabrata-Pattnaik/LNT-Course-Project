Problem Statement: To develop a dynamic solar panel positioning system using microcontroller

Scope of the solution:
This solution I propose can be used on any kind of solar panel depployment platform especially on roofs or houses. 
Solar panels are also deployed in open fields for harvesting power, however it may not be efficient, simply using the minimal 
apparatus of the microcontroller and Servo motors ensures full efficiency of the solar panels. 
Fixed solar panels would capture 60% of the light that falls on it, however using a single axis rotation won't be enough.
Using the dual axis motor for rotation to face maxiumum light intensity boosts efficiency for solar panels.

Required Components:
1. Arduino IDE
2. TinkerCad software
3. Arduino Uno
4. 4 Light dependant resistors
5. 2 Servo motors
6. 4 1 Kilo-Ohm Resistors

The video of the demo, gerber file, project report in pdf and the tinkercad circuit is uploaded here.

Result:
As a result of varying light intensities in each LDR, the servo motors reacted accordingly to maximise the light that falls on the LDR.
